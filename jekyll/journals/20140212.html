<p>Here's the hook: there is a sci-fi novel "written" by William Shatner about a colony on Mars. The colony
is eventually forced to declare independence from Earth, because the politicians on Earth are unwilling to
understand or even help with the difficulties encountered by the people on Mars. On Earth, 
the difficulties of Mars are downplayed and ignored, and they are even sabotaged. </p>

<p>That's a little how I see the internet. It allowed a generation of fresh colonists to gain independence. To build
something new, a place where they could be in control. The early internet colonists had a special power. They could
turn thoughts into messages heard around the world, no longer limited by the heavily censored mainstream. </p>

<p>There were outsiders everywhere yearning to build something new. To ignore the boring unchanging 
and unwelcoming world in front of them in favor of the new. To find their own power. They gave themselves over
completely to the new rules of the game.</p>

<p>But when the dust settled, and the tools were eventually built, 
you are left with insiders and outsiders yet again. The original outsiders
 put their guns away and settle down into ranch life. They start counting traffic, and money. </p>

<p>In order to become an insider, you need to start thinking differently. It's no 
longer about benefitting anyone other than yourself. 
You get the luxury of treating people differently. 
You engage in politics. </p>

<p>The once meek and humble geeks become the new aristocracy. Instead of being excited by new ideas,
they now become threatened by them. Instead of programming open source tools, they go closed source. </p>

<p>The people who wrote the original code for google search no longer work there. 
They didn't get fame, though they probably made some money.
They were either forced to settle into new roles as maintainers, or they let go of their dreams. 
A generation of bloggers took their place. 
They had to let go of the work they did, only to have it be used by a hollow corporation run by suits. </p>

<p>And the suits rarely care about the blood sweat and tears that went into building something great. 
Or even the ideas that went into it. What they want is a finished product. 
And they can only appreciate it in terms of money. They have no choice. 
By their nature, they are much more concerned 
with reaping the rewards. To them, communities are just leverage. </p>

<p>The insiders will tell you that there were no supermen. That the internet wasn't built by a handful of 
people. That the contributions of the people in the past were all collective. That the original
outsiders don't exist. 
</p>

<p>So the outsiders are forced to move on. They're not content to hash and rehash the boring
present. The unpleasant reality that all our dreams and optimism have become high yield businesses.
And the world once again becomes an unwelcoming and unfriendly place. </p>

<p>Perhaps the only bit of optimism is to remember that everyone is an outsider, or was
an outsider once. They reaped the rewards, but they didn't write the kernels. They are still
on the same footing as everyone else. They didn't write any of the content that is now
making them rich. That is a job for outsiders. Outsiders are forced to pour their 
tears into the content, with the hope of becoming an insider. For outsiders, it becomes
a fools game. </p>

<p> And while everyone is rushing to be an insider, to have access to the free booze, it's 
only with outsiders do people really have an equal voice. It's not just a podium with a microphone and
a canned message. You don't see the power struggles from the outside. You only see the shiny
product.</p>

<p>Only with outsiders is the world still fresh and new. And there are still avenues to be explored. 
With people who understand what it is to be real, and to really feel. 
People who explore because it's natural, not motivated by the promise of power. 
It's these outsiders that push the limits of technology, because they aren't blinded by their
own self interest. The insiders start to forget what it even meant to be an outsider, and turn 
their backs. </p>
