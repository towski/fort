<p>
3 years ago I had a crisis. 
I started to wonder, am I doing enough with my life? Am I contributing to my job? Am I able to contribute to open source?
What does my long term outlook look like?
</p>

<p>
Fundamentally my philosophy works like this: My only goal is to make my friends laugh until they cry. Or share things
with them that will blow their mind in a positive way. My perspective is that humans have a lot to share. 
Especially uniqueness. However, the engineer in me started to disagree, and thinks this is hippy bullshit. 
Suddenly politics seemed unavoidable. The inability to escape the intense selfishness of human beings. 
</p>

<p>
Also humans enjoy the opportunity to be creative. More than money, drugs, sex, anything. You can achieve
all the success or failure you want, you will feel the most human while you are creating.
If you place limitations on what counts as creative, then you are missing the point. Everyone
likes to be creative in a specific way, and they can feel stifiled that way. I love to 
play music that will make people feel happy, but lament when people aren't receptive to that. 
People who only like a single kind of music, that I find boring. Or being able to
make a joke or offer an imaginative suggestion. I enjoy doing these things
more than anything else.
</p>

<p>
If you restrict creativity to "things that make money" or "things that get other people to like me",
then you will be less creative. Suddenly the solutions need to be less organic, and more organized. 
And all the joy and fun is lost. 
</p>

<p>But is eternal creativity possible? After all, artists often seem to rely on sex or drugs for inspiration.
At least, certain popular artists. Getting your creativity from other people can be hazardous,
as people can be intentionally negative or anti-creative. More complications.
Suddenly, I was unable to contribute to other peoples well-being, in the way of my choosing.
Because we need these things to recharge us. In Los Angeles, it's almost like the sun charges
people up. Gives them energy, optimism. I got the impression that people avoid negativity like
darkness. And while negativity can be a fact of life, I always felt like everyone should always
run from it. Negativity and death are similar forces. Ultimately inescapable, but
in the idealized life, a person would remain optimistic and hopeful, up until the very end. 
</p>

<p>
Portland wasn't refilling my creative cup. Tired negativity was filling up my mind. I was slowly
turning into a tree. And San Francisco, with it's seemingly swirling selfishness, did not seem to
offer me anything to restore myself. I knew that throwing myself into the figurative washing machine 
seemed like a bad idea, but I didn't have much choice. 
</p>

<p>
I began to notice just much I relied on in my own life. Since I devoted all my time to my mental programming contributions,
virtually all other aspects of my life were neglected. Instead of nurishing creativity and emotional contribution,
I was drinking with friends. Instead of cooking, doing laundry, mana. It was difficult to even read my own mail,
since that seemed. My brain seemed to be disappearing into the internet.
</p>

<p>
I had to start asking some difficult questions. First above all, was all that time I spent helping my friends wasted? 
None of it seemed to be getting back to me.
I always enjoyed going out, livening things up with some creative conversation, and trying to cheer people
up when they were down. 
But who was helping me? Worried about me? Why was no one reaching out to me?
Strangers started to be more aggressivly unhelpful to me. 
Suddenly humans were starting to look a lot more like baboons. People were happy to receive emotional
support, but seemed reticent to provide any.
</p>


<p>
It doesn't help that I'm a man with the idea that I'm not supposed to rely on support from other people.
It's simply not mannish. So given all that, I seemed to be at a 
</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I do believe in the ability of humans to help each other. But I did seem to reach a point where
nothing could help me. So I moved to SF. As a human, you need to live where the good things come to you. You can't
forever seek them out. Technology has changed this somewhat. It can be hard to discern where the actual
good is. It can be cloaked in a web of 'likes' and +1's.</p>

<p>
See, I like to help my friends. Even though ultimately we will all die, I think we should laugh 
as much as we can. 
</p>

<p>
The internet has made this much more visible. I don't believe it has fundamentally changed how humans interact,
but it has certainly made it much more discrete. People sometimes use facebook or twitter as a measure
of contribution. But of course, it's only hypothetical contribution. Listening to Miley Cyrus
may or may not be actually benefitial to your well-being.
</p>

<p>See, it is natural to enjoy contributing to other people's well-being. But ironically, there are people who are keen
to get all the credit. Humans can be pretty, foolish, turning their back on mother nature. Like the corporation that
realizing that the fuel it runs on is human kindness and betrayal. 
</p>

<p>
Some of my friends and lovers seemed to have misplaces all the energy I had put in them. Or they had just naturally
run out themselves. I suddently realized what an existential problem life is. And why being a push-over can be bad. 
I always sought to find good things, so I could share them with others. But if other artists are simply ripping
you off and taking the credit, what good is there in helping other people? 
</p>

<p>And because so few people find themselves in the spotlight, that spotlight is often abused. 
We must remember that there is always an explanation for another individuals .
Just as all products we own are built on cheap labor from China and the difficult conditions
of miners. If you ignore those things, then you are hogging the spotlight. It's
only if you recognize how privileged your condition is that you can be existentially whole.
</p>

<p>
The human web is complex. Suddenly there are great perceived benefits to being attractive. Young. 
Being honest and good-natured seemed foolish. People will cut you down and reap the profits. 
Like that guy who got cut out of twitter. Human betrayal at the worst. 
</p>

<p>
Like the irony of the open source contributor who feels anxiety when they aren't relevant anymore. 
You need to feel like your contribution is helping.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly all my mental creativity and ability was useless. If I can theoretically be replaced. 
</p>

<p>
Humans are very political. And I started to notice that while I was trying to contribute to other people.
Were other people contributing to me? I felt like I had reached obselence at 28. Which made me 
slightly bitter, and I had to reconsider all the things in my life.
</p>

<p>
So does it matter if you help other people, if in the end, the victor seems to be the person 
whose name is on the marquee?
</p>

<p>
That's where the danger comes in. See, no one accomplishes anything in a vacuum. Every shining star is supported
by a vast network of other human beings. And the big names are eager to become some animatronic likeness. 
The illusion that one person can be 
</p>

<p>Einstein was just an easy name to remember. Like Newton. Or Shakespeare. People forget that these people are more like 
brands than people. They relied on 
</p>

<p>Just as all open source contributors relie on a vast dependency web of technologies, the musician depends on their fans, and the 
scientists depends on thousands of years of prior science. 
</p>


<p>
And me, who always believed that the results 
If you kill your best friend for a billion dollars, you maybe find that he/she was your Rosebud.
