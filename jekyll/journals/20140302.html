Working on <a href='http://skylines.herokuapp.com'>skyline</a> has helped me understand my own experiences with cities. 
It was fun to do a bit of design for a relatively simple rails app.

In fact, understanding and thinking in general has gotten easier lately. 
I'm not sure why my thoughts all seemed so dark. It was like I tried to mentally digest a huge evil.
Maybe it was my own mortality.  It's hard to describe what if feels like
when even thinking itself is painful.  
It makes me realize how dependent we are on our own sanity and emotional well-being, and 
what life is like for people without that. 
It makes technology seem like a toy that can't really solve any real problems.

I feel a little like Siddhartha, leaving Los Angeles and discovering how the world really works. Or at least, how it
works outside Los Angeles. Just being in California, there is infinitely more optimism. 
There is a huge darkness in the world, and it's only safe to contemplate from California. </p>
