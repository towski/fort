Spent the day soldering(!). Some chunko snipped some wires on my custom electric bike while ripping off the display, so I had to 
buy a new computer and display (<a href='http://www.leafbike.com/products/brushless-motor-controller/36v-lcd-motor-controller/36v-750w-electric-bike-motor-controller-952.html'>100 bucks</a>), and reattach the connectors.
I was half convinced that it wouldn't work, since I know nothing about connectors, solder, wires.
I figured I would mess up one of the connectors, and the day would end in frustration and despair.
</p>
<p>
There were a total of 11 wires I had to resolder. With the new controller, I had to change some of the
previously male adapters to be female. The first wire was a real hassle. Cut myself trying to
loosen the gold metal clasps. At least I think it's gold. 
Then attaching the wire again with the pliers was difficult, because the
wire would just slip out. I pined for a better way.
</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was. Solder everything! I stopped messing around with the pliers and just slathered
on the solder. After a few test connectors, the rest of the connectors were refastened. 
Now I needed to make sure all the wires would reconnect properly.
</p>
<p> My biggest fear was that I'd hook it all up, and it just wouldn't work. In the past, the power wire
had a loose connection, so occasionally things just wouldn't work. 
Also with the new controller, the wiring diagrams changed. In the old controller, the colors of the wires
didn't match up.</p>
<p>At first tried hooking things up the old way. Comedically, that lead to the tire making a weird noise and going in reverse. 
At least I was reassured that everything was functioning, and on the first try. Big sigh of relief. 
I took a leap of faith, and tried matching up all the colors between the connections. Success!
The web site I bought the parts from, <a href='http://leafbike.com/'>Leaf Bike</a>, made a few improvements to the
schematic, and now it makes more sense. 
</p>
<p>Spent a bit more time organizing the components and wires around the bike, and positioning everything in the enclosure.
Overall it felt like an upgrade, and the best was yet to come.</p>
<p>
The upgrade enabled some new features. 
Now the speedometer and the odometer work without separate sensors. 
And the data it records lasts after you turn the bike off and back on, so it's more like a car. 
And the battery gauge doesn't jump around as much. 
Electric Bike v0.2! Better than a new iphone. 
</p>
<p>
Went for an evening jaunt after it was all done. 15.0 miles. Average speed was around 17mph. Time on the bike:
1 hour 20 minutes. Used about 3/4 of the juice. Through SOMA, up Embaracadero, back down Columbus, and past
Union Square. Will have to try out a GPS plotting app. Takeway: Wires are your friend. Numbers are fun.
