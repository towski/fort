<p>
There are places that sap me emotionally. They don't understand the power and fragility of emotion.
Every human that has ever lived has been powered by emotions. Every war. Every stock market crash.
They are the most powerful force in human life.
</p>

<p>
Given their extreme power over us as individuals and as a society, you would think there would 
be a greater interest in exploring emotions. There is a great gulf between the emotional world
and the intellectual world. Intellectuals often suppress their own emotions, for strange
self justifying reasons. And emotional people find intellectuals to be cold and unfeeling.
</p>

<p>
In exploring the intellectual world, I have seen the huge danger of this emotional suppress.
Inadaptable societies heading for economic turmoil. Places that use alcohol to free their
emotions, only the find themselves slaves.
</p>

<p>
Being in control of your own emotions is incredibly valuable. But though you may harness them,
you will never fully control them. I don't personally think the "adult" thing to do is to hide or 
suppress your emotions, it is impossible. You will only lash out in unexplained ways.
</p>

<p>
Emotions are how we adapt to other humans. How we determine what other people need. 
Don't turn your back on mother nature.
</p>

<p>
So much of our world is tied to these internal forces. 
Imagine you were to invent an app that would make people happy. Would
you use the app indescriminately? Would there be side-effects to overuse of the app? Isn't this just
Zynga? Would this power be abused? Obviously. Entire corporate structures form, administering
happiness to people based on changing criteria, always surreptitiously accepting money to provide
"more happiness".
</p>

<p>
But it's even stranger to realize that a lot of the power to be happy is within us. Our brains
are ultimately what doses us. Brings us happiness. We have some choice over what makes us happy.
Although I've learned, that being around low emotion people is a quick trip to becomining a low
emotional person. People who don't allow themselves to feel are their own enemies.
</p>

<p>
It's difficult for anyone to talk about their emotions. Especially an engineer. But I've realized
</p>

<p>
Yet so many people ignore their significance. Even deride them. To their own peril and disfunction.
</p>

<p>
I expected the cities of
the world to all behave similarly emotionally. But surprisingly, emotions are the least understood of 
human forces. We can all build bridges and trains, but do we all know how to react when someone
is dancing? Crying?
</p>

<p>
There is a concern that technology is deadening people emotionally. People no longer dance as freely
as they used to. Nerds might even call this "progress". Thankfully, there is no such thing as 
progress, only supression. 
</p>
