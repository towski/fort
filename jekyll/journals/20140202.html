<p>I had a dream last night. A nerdy dream. 
A dream to stop splitting my identity into a million different pieces. To rebuild my own internet home. 
About keeping all my data on my own devices, and not letting the internet push and pull me around. 
</p>

<p>It feels like the internet has been going in the wrong direction.
The excitement for the internet has died for a lot of people, because of the reality. The reality of centralized services,
like honeypots, finding ways to get suckers to give them data. The more I think about it, the more I feel like sites
like Facebook and Google are doing it all wrong. Taking and storing all the worlds information in one place is a waste
of time and effort.</p>

<p> I think all users should
be responsible for their own data. If someone wants to access their data, they should ask. 
It seems like centralized services are using the internet wrong. 
Publishing to the anonymous web is good for self promotion, but it should just be a replica of your own data.
Stop giving away your data, and your time, for free. Centralized websites are wasting everyones time, to their own profit. </p>

<h3>Tech Stuff</h3>
<p>Anyways, by far the coolest thing I learned all day was:
<p>
<code>
	require 'debugger' <br/>
	Debugger.wait_connection = true <br/>
	Debugger.start_remote <br/>
	debugger
</code>
</p>
and
<p>
<code>rdebug -c</code>
</p>
I think I was told about it once, but there wasn't much documentation on the web about it. Anyways, I found it <a href='http://chrisadams.me.uk/2009/04/28/how-to-set-up-a-debugger-with-mod_railspassenger/'>here</a>. It seems like Google isn't so great at indexing ruby blog posts anymore. Most of the google results for 'ruby remote debug' are useless. I'm
pretty happy I can debug unicorns again. </p>

<p>I also read <a href='http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/4/'>this article</a> about creating your own language, since I was digging
around in the ruby code yesterday. I added some self-hosted git repos to <a href='/'>towski.no-ip.biz</a> so I'm not pushing my data to yet another centralized
service.</p>

<p>I also spent a lot of time in nginx today, adding a unicorn process that can interact with my phone. I messed around with some basic uploading stuff, so I
could implement 'tweets'. It's actually pretty nice to have tweets all be local, and then I can push them to twitter, but only if I want to. </p>
