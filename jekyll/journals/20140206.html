<p>Spent the day compiling and recompiling C code. I was trying to get ruby into a form that golang can read, so I could write
a ruby interpretter in go. It was easy to get into the C code and build something that would write the AST walker. But 
unforetunately it might be hard to give access to the AST nodes in Go. It was fun playing around with bison, 
but the version I was using was really old. It would be hard to build something that could handle more modern ruby.
</p>

<p>Reading more recent articles lead me to a javascript and flash ruby bridge.  It uses the bytecode that ruby 1.9.3 can output to build a runtime. 
You can grab the bytecode with this:</p>

<code>
 seq = RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile_file("./myapp.rb")
 seq.disassemble
</code>

<p> That might make things much easier. Tomorrow I will try and execute that bytecode in go.</p>
