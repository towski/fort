<p>Today I pulled the code for my simple ORM out into a <a href="https://github.com/towski/dbm_orm">ruby gem</a>. I need to put the gem in both 
my web project (this) and my android app (jruby). It basically stores the info for the data that I'm going to be exchanging back and forth between
my phone and my computer. 
</p>

<p>Had some hiccups getting the tests to all run, and prayed that the different implementations of DBM wouldn't be a problem. Thankfully, just vendoring
my gem in the my JRuby android project worked fine. Well almost. I did have to do something to get require 'json' to work, but it was a small something.
</p>

<p>I then worked on sending actual json back and forth through the UDP socket between the two endpoints. Easy, since 
most of that code was already there.  It was fun to see the data flowing between my phone and my computer, so
I started working on a generic way to make requests from my computer to my phone. </p>
<p>
But I realized I'm getting a little ahead of myself, and I need to spend some time writing tests for the android app. 
Ruboto has some testing built-in, so I got them running. The server could also use some tests, and the code could use some 
cleanup overall. Never enough tests!

<p>Watched the Movie "The Lady from Shanghai". The plot was hard to follow, but the message is clear. The evil folks of the world will tear each other
apart eventually. Let's hope Orson Welles is right.

Snippet of the day: converting all your tabs to spaces.

<p>
<code>
find . -name "*rb" -exec vim -c "retab|wq" {} \;
</code>
</p>
vim -c seems pretty useful and cool. Not sure whether to thank <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9366243/execute-a-command-within-vim-from-the-command-line'>stack overflow</a>  or google.
