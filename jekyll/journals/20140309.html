The older you get the more you realize that other people are performing for you. And what would
it be like if they stopped performing.
</p>

<p>
People develop ability individually, given space and resources. It's natural for humans to grow in this way. 
It isn't anything inherent or special to certain individuals. Unecessary competition only means that less
people are allowed to develop in this way. 
</p>

<p>
Places like New York are addicted to the new. That means when the styles change, all the old venues
are closed and reconfigured. In places that develop at a consistent pace, things from the past stick
around for when people realize what a mistake it was to tear it down.

<p>When I was younger I had a fantasy of the forest.</p>

<p>Some people want something specific. A beautiful woman. A nice house. A chunk of change. I am looking for an experience. </p>

<p>Most people try every avenue. And it leads them around. Like an endless maze of doors. Few people open the right door
at the right time. </p>
