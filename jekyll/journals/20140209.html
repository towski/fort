Went down to Palo Alto to have lunch with some old high school friends. It was good to see them doing well
</p>

Got home and worked on my android app some more. It definitely can be a chore trawling through the java
documentation. Context and ContextWrappers. Java seems to have trouble naming things in any meaningful
way, not sure why every java codebase always has such awkward names. WTF is an Intent? 
Mostly succeeded in getting a process to run in the background, and am able to send notifications.
</p>


<p>Tired, but it is surprisingly fun to write Java knowing that it is a part of the Android
runtime. Ruby and ruboto make this task a lot easier, though it could be improved.</p>
