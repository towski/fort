<p>
Felt a little overwhelmed today so I drifted into my own favorite hobby, overthinking the internet. 
I admire people who have amassed incredible power through the internet. 
I enjoy using the internet to enhance my own powers. 
But the average internet user is probably feeling their power slip away.
Probably because we are putting our lives into other peoples hands more and more. 
</p>

<p>In my own life, the internet has been a good and a bad thing. 
I have felt a loss of control in my own life, no matter how much I tried to contribute
back to the intenet. Plus I've always valued personal understanding,
so I've built up as large a personal understanding of the world as I could. 
But the internet can be disruptive to that understanding. Who is asking the deep questions
to strangers? What do you see when you look at the world?
</p>

<p>I have always sought to explore and experience "realness". More than money or sex or alcohol, realness has
always replenished my own personal connection with the world. 
Those people and places that have created their own identity, and fought to maintain themselves despite the constant tug
of the world.  I can tell by looking at a place if it has any identity left.
You get a deeply human feeling connecting with those places. 
Like seeing an old disco, and imagining the lives and people that used to go there. 
</p>

<p>You can learn a lot by actually visiting a place, and seeing it in context. 
When I visited Martin Luther King's grave I was surprised at how disconnected it seemed.
It made me realize how alienated his dream still is, and how difficult it is to convey
the meaning of his life. And all places eventually lose their own identity, and people can no longer absorb their meaning. 
The Eiffel Tower from one angle is basically just another monument in Vegas. 
</p>

<p>
People are also trying to build up their own identities.  With their scars and frustrations. Only the select few make
it through life without any major tragedies. I can't identity anymore with people for whom everything has always gone 
right. Personally, I don't think that's anything to admire. It just means you never tried anything interesting.
</p>
<p>
The internet has changed this a little. What is my own personal experience worth anymore?
I used to have my own story, my own identity. How do I convey to you the deep feelings I've had?
I miss the personal connections I would make based on my own experiences.
</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel surrounded by people for whom personal experience isn't valuable. 
People who don't ask questions, or dig into other peoples lives. 
Perhaps my own personal flaw is that I would always trade everything for something real. 
I can't settle for the facade because I know that there is nothing on the other side. 
Realness is only contained in a real place, in a real person.
The internet doesn't have this fullness. The internet is just a space for temporary things. 
</p>

<p>And I've always felt obligated to follow my own feelings. Because no matter what, you are chained to your own experiences. 
The internet leaves a lot of people without feeling. And I always thought we should celebrate feelings.
But if your feelings are shallow, what's to celebrate? I always value the people who have felt the most, good and bad.
When I no longer had any feelings to guide me, I lost control of my own life. 
How do we break down the emotional barriers of the internet? I feel like Reddit does a good job, but it's
still essentially anonymous. How do we reward people for having a deeply meaningful existence?
