<p>This is the story of the deepest pain I have ever felt. A pain so deep, that
it penetrated into the deepest core of my being, and shattered me. A pain
that I couldn't brush off, or even explain. It's a pain that I 
still don't fully understand. </p>

<p>I always brushed pain off, avoided suffering. 
And felt reasonably secure in my world. </p>

<p>But then, I started to have my doubts. And I started having to question
things. It made me question the trajectory I was taking in my life.
It eventually it made me question everything. </p>

<p>See I never experienced a pain so deep that it breaks you. I had always been 
fairly fortunate. Things hadn't always gone my way. But I was fairly optimistic
and good natured about it. I always felt it would be a waste to let the 
negativity swallow you. People that are negative are clearly damaged, right?
I always recognized that and avoided them. </p>

<p>And I always felt like I was careful, even if I has made reckless decisions.
But I started to realize that the dark side of the world was much bigger than 
I thought. All the things I thought would always be there, started to slip away. 
And I couldn't account for all the negativity I was surrounded with. 
</p>

<p>Sometimes a pain can get so deep that it shatters your very being. And overnight 
I went from being the optimistic good natured guy that I always enjoyed being, 
to a completely distraught, insecure, unhappy, confused person. </p>

<p>But tragedy happens.
