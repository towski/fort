<p>
Much effort has been put into using computers to automatically drive.
But apparently less effort has been put into reasoning about HOW to solve 
that problem. 
</p>

<p>
If you were really interested in an automated driving system, you would go about it
in a much simpler way. Your first thought wouldn't be, how do I get a computer get a car to
drive itself. 
</p>

<p>
Your first thought would be, how do I get a car to automatically get from one place to another. 
Don't worry about the HOW we do that yet. Just reframe the problem. Then you might realize,
that you don't need an entirely new type of vehicle for that with an incredibly complicated
AI, set at a price that is unaffordable to most people.
You don't need a computer that will automatically
decide when to change lanes. Or even which route to take. 
</p>

<p>What you need is a way to remotely control a car. See, the user doesn't really care HOW the 
car drives itself. Just that it does. And the easiest, safest, and most trustable method
for doing so, is to have another human control the car remotely.
