<p>Been busy the last 5 days working with a team for the <a href="http://hackathon.launch.co/schedule">launch hackfest</a>. We spent
the last 48 hours hacking on an iPhone app (details secret). I learned a ton, from how apps are made, how they're pitched, how to work on a team,
and a bunch of specific technologies.</p>

<p>To prepare developing iOS apps on my linux laptop, I installed Mac OSX in a VirtualBox. I can even
allocate 2 CPUs to speed it up a bit. I used the iatkos2 image to get it installed,
and after that I got XCode working. Then I installed some test apps on my iPod touch. It was all pretty painless, and
although it has glitches, it worked for the duration of the hackfest. I definitely recommend giving it more then 20GB,
because it can be difficult to resize. </p>

<p>I was mostly working on the backend, for which we used the <a href='https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api'>rails-api</a> gem with
rails 3.2.17, and mongoid. We were deploying the whole thing to heroku, which was (as always) pretty seemless. I had hesitations about using
Mongodb, but the <a href='https://twitter.com/shabuta'>product guy</a> had good experience with it, and it was pretty easy to get the models all working. 
It's very different from your typical relationaldb, so there are probably problems with scaling etc. But it was perfect for a 
weekend hackfest.</p>

<p>I wrote out a Google Doc spec for the api before we started, and actually enjoyed writing out a spec. It worked, although
I didn't always keep it updated. Initially I was just using cURL to manipulate the API data, 
but when I finally switched to using <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en'>postman</a> 
(the chrome app) it made a huge difference. I could easily verify that all the api calls were working, and tweak the data that way. </p>

<p>Then I focused on getting the push notifications working. I got the <a href='https://github.com/nomad/houston'>houston</a> gem
working on a test app before the hackfest started, and spent a chunk of time getting it to work with our shared app once the hackfest
started. Luckily we had an experienced iOS dev on the team to help, and once the push requests were working he hooked them into the app.
I looked at adding some basic language processing for the app with the treat gem, it worked well enough.</p>

<p>I even did a little iOS development towards the end, formatting some table cells. The app itself is actually pretty slick, big props to
<a href='https://twitter.com/shabuta'>shabuta</a> for the idea. I was lucky to get to work with such an experienced team. The event gave
me some new ideas for projects. </p>
