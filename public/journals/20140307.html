<p>
People are always drawing lines between them and other people. Arbitrary lines. This person can do that. This person is like this. They do this 
therfore they are this way. The truth is terrifying. People are not characters. They do not know their own state. They do not
behave consistently. They don't know about the world outside themselves. They do not think. 
</p>

<p>Yet everyone has the same conscious. Our minds work the same at a low level. We are largely all the same. Yet we try to make ourselves
seem different. There people that get deep into your mind, and how they do that is very simple. They go deep into themselves. The people
that deny this sameness are closed to themselves. They deny their own reality. </p>

<p>When you focus on these differences, trying to separate yourself from other people, that's when you ruin your own ability to 
share in this place. Efforts to simulate this connection, through phones, will not bring you any closer to other people.
You can only connect with people who connect with themselves. Who are fundamentally united. </p>

<p>To destroy this unity is to destroy yourself. To insist that you are different.  </p>

<p>You can twist yourself up, and wrinkle your own smoothness. You will want to go back to that smooth feeling. That harmony. That
peacefulness. Natural calm. You will destroy yourself and think that you will never get back to smoothness. To calm. </p>

<p>The smooth experience is preferable to the rough turbulence. Yet, somehow the smooth experience can be a pathway
to oblivion. A smooth ride is a path to oblivion. Like a raft over the river styx. </p>

<p>The world is not smooth and clean. Perhaps we are making it more so. But perhaps by making it more so we are agitating ourselves.
For we are part of it. It is us. For every rape and murder you are the criminal. You are trying to cut this out of yourself.
You are curious about it. You are seeking new thrills. You do not listen to yourself.</p>

<p>Reality is terribly frightening. It is loud. And it doesn't fully make sense. I see why people shy away from it. Invent
other worlds in which to live. But we are built for reality. We are built to feel. 
</p>
<p>
I recall how frightening my experiences in Chicago <a href='http://skylines.herokuapp.com/users/towski'>were</a>.
It scared me to watch Chicago change in front of me. I was scurrying not to get caught under a collapsing building with the shadow on me
as it fell. 
But also Portland at a certain point was frightening. Frighteningly quiet. Frighteningly rural. 
</p>
<p>
Things that don't make sense are scary. Especially when there is never any hope of them ever making sense. 
Events that disappear into the past without any conclusion. 
You pour sand over everything and are left with a painting. 
You compete against people that somehow have a better understanding that they won't share. 
</p>
<p>
I finally understand why people with safety can't understand the difference
between good and bad. Because it's all the same to them. You don't have much empathy for things you've
never experienced. Or even interest. Why does it even matter, when we are sleeping peacefully. 
</p>
<p>
The intellectual world is also frightening. How do you live without feeling? What good is alcohol when you feel nothing?
</p>
<p>
I had been drinking. And in my drink everything seemed the same. I no longer had any hunger. I would eat
not because I was hungry, but because there would be pain if I didn't eat. Life was a neverending series of
work, sustaining yourself for no reason. There didn't seem to be a reason anymore. No one else seemed worth
the investment. No one else had bothered to check the facts. Or could see why discussing them was so important.  </p>
<p>
My only desire to get a reaction in people was only
ending badly. I could not ellicit the interest in other people without theatrics. And I hate theatrics. The source material 
is important for getting an effect in people. What use is explaining something to people who will never understand. 
Who are not interested in understanding. 
</p>
<p>
It's my maladie that I never know what I'm seeing when I look at it. I have to see it in action. Theoretically a spoon
may be used in a certain way. But if I don't see it used, I wouldn't have the vaguest guess how to use it.
</p>

If Paris is no longer Paris, then where is? Reading Hemingway makes me feel drunk

Unrelated: 
Don't intellectualize anything until you're 30. It's a waste of time. In your 20s, take in as much as you can. That is your
unique experience that no other person has, or ever will have. It is smooth, like an oar stroke on water. You can watch the ripples
of the water.
