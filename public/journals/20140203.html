<p>I was getting my system backups setup today, when I stumbled across some pictures from my old work hard-drive. It had all the pictures from my
Iphone in Portland, up until I left. I was suddenly taken by nostalgia for those times. 3 very special years, when the world, and the internet, seemed
young.  I haven't felt that particular twinge of sadness in a while.  </p>

<p> When I got to Portland I was thrown into the world of the web elite. I didn't realize what it would be like to work with the smartest people
on the internet. Compared to them I was somewhat uninitiated. I had been doing it for a few years, but not next to the smartest programmers in the world.
It was a learning experience that I still think about.</p>

<p>Anyways, I put all this nostalgia into <a href="http://towski.no-ip.biz/pictures.html"> one place </a></p>
<h3>Tech Stuff</h3>
<p>
The following 7 lines give me an important chunk of jQuery functionality, easy access to those hard to reach elements, so I can fudge with them:
</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/towski/8799679.js"></script>
</p>
<p>
There is something I don't like about using jQuery, and I think I'm starting to see what it is. 
The library makes it hard to know what is built-in to the language, and what is part of jQuery. I
am actually preferring to work with the straight javascript api. It's not really that wordy, when you
consider all the things it can do. And you can use Chrome and Web inspect to get the XPath of a hard to reach element.</p>
<p>
Also decided to build my own simple ORM using Berkeley Databases, for Thoughts on my <a href='/'>homepage</a>. 
I figure they might be a great solution for a mostly read-only environment, with only one writer. They can <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17275_01/html/programmer_reference/cam.html#cam_intro'>handle concurrency</a>, so multiple unicorns. And they just seem simpler than sqlite or mysql, especially for a small
self-hosted website. I am using the <a href='https://github.com/ruby-bdb/sbdb'>DBDB gem </a>.
Code for that is in <a href='https://github.com/towski/fort'>fort</a>, but I'll probably split it off into
it's own repository. I am reminded that the most important reason to build things yourself is to learn.
</p>

<p> Lots of messing about today. Had fun playing with unicorn signals and rdebug, and moving repositories around. Tomorrow I will probably add some more Models
for the Berkeley Database ORM, and maybe do some Mobile programming. </p>
