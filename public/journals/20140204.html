It's all technical today, no nostalgia.
I spent a lot of time in javaland. Java has always kind of scared the shit out of me. How to jar? How to use jar?
The first major hurdle was trying to figure out jar dependencies. The XML and the directory structure
 make it seem much more complicated than it is. Then with JRuby you can simply do:
</p>
<p>
<code>
library = org.jruby.ext.dbm.DBMLibrary.new
</code>
</p>
<p>
Java is like an elephant. 
Hard as hell to get going, but once you do, it will flip cars over. I can personally write ruby much much quicker. 
But there's threading and GC and whatever else you want to complain about. In JRuby, I think you get real concurrency with just:
</p>

<p>
<code>
	Thread.new { .. }
</code>
</p>
<p>
And that's basically what I'm doing in my Android app for now (until I figure something better out).
Apparently that's all it takes to get a background process on your phone. 
I am appreciating ruboto and jruby more and more. They are best buds for life.
</p>

<p>
However, it did take forever to get the code for <a href='https://github.com/jruby/dbm'>this</a> JRuby port of DBM 
onto my phone so I could have a file database. There are probably better options, but I like the simplicity of the interface. 
It makes use of <a href="https://github.com/jankotek/MapDB">MapDB</a>, which I can probably just use on it's own eventually.
</p>

<p>This probably sounds kind of dumb, but the single most import thing I learned today is:  if your jar depends on another jar, and you add your jar to another project,
you also need to include the other jar. Once it's there, JRuby is happy and won't throw strange errors. 
</p>

<p>After all that fun, I got back to programming just straight JRuby.
I setup a socket on my phone that stays open to the server, so if we get any requests we can handle them peer-to-peer style. It's basically
a way for me to request data from my phone on my computer. There are still lots of kinks to work out, but it's solid progress. Not much exciting other than
that, unless you count listening to Daft Punk for the nth time. </p>
