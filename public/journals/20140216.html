<p>Would it kill you to read some Stendhal? </p>

<p>It can be a little fatalistic and negative to read through the deepest depths of human experience, written down. Still, I can't
help but feel a little disappointed by people. They don't seem to take any interest in the reality behind the fantasy. </p>

<p>Granted, it is a little much to ask other people to learn french. Or to read realistic books. But still, I can't
help but feel isolated by my own interests. </p>

<p>Really no one I know has read the Red and the Black? There is something about identifying deeply with something
that really plumbs the depths.</p>
