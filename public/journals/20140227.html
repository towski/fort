<p>
Human existence can be difficult to comprehend. We are born at a time. The world has changed drastically since then,
and now we're here. The overall world population has increased a lot since you were born. Technology has changed,
and so has industry. But more important than that, is your own personal adaptation. </p>

<p>You are either personally responding to the changes around you, or you are stuck in time. You either
keep up with all the latest, or you fall behind. </p>

<p>It's scary and awesome to see these larger changes up close. I could practically watch buildings collapse in
Chicago. Bask is the unchanging timelessness of Portland. Cruise through Los Angeles, which changes at a very
human pace. And San Francisco, which is changing rapidly. </p>

<p>I personally had to adapt, or try to, in all of these places. And it terrified me that so many people are stuck
in situations that can't control. And I got to a place where I couldn't adapt anymore. 
After 28 years I finally lost my cool. I couldn't pretend that everything was alright.
