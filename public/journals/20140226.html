<p>
Was horsing around a bit too much with Debian Testing and Unstable, and managed to break everything. But I backed everything
up before I started messing around, so it was the first test of my backup system. I rsync my whole filesystem to a USB
harddrive, with the assumption that I can just rsync it back if anything goes too wrong. But would it work?
</p>
<p>
I soon learned that I wasn't sending the --delete command to rsync, so I wasn't ever deleting files on my backup. Hopefully
that wouldn't be a big deal, since I've only been backing up for about a week. However, I wasn't sure how the grub stuff
would work, since I seemed to hose it pretty bad. 
</p>
<p>Thanksfully, just chrooting to my freshly rsync'ed harddrive and doing grub-install /dev/sda1 worked like a charm. Everything
was back to last night, so I could do a better job upgrading my system to testing. Now I'm upgraded to Debian testing, and
everything seems to work fine.
</p>
<p>All because I wanted to install a new linux library for my ipod, to fix an issue. </p>
