I built a command line tool to request data from my phone and receive it peer-to-peer directly to my computer. 
It was really fun to use. My phone suddenly transformed into a BBS. 
</p>

<p>Speaking of old school, I went back to <a href='http://scripting.com'>Dave Winer's blog</a> after many years away
and was happy to see he's still active. His simple blog design is an inspiration. It makes me reflect
on that earlier period of the internet. I can only imagine what the Bay Area must have been like 15 years ago.
I can still feel the warmth from the coals.  It also inspired me to move some of my html around. </p>

<p>Also my go ruby bytecode interpretter is further along now. I enjoyed it more 
when I realized that every object in my ruby runtime could be an Object pointer. 
For example: the Class Object is instantiated and sent as the class of every new class object:</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
CLASS = &Object{} <br/>
IO = NewObject(CLASS, "IO") <br/>
</code>
</p>
<p>For now each class has a map for storing references to it's functions.
Here is the code for defining the internal ruby method IO#puts:</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
    IO.methods[":puts"] = func(v ...*Object) *Object {<br/> 
    ...<br/>
    }                                                 <br/>  
</code>
</p>

<p>It's a function that takes any number of Object pointers, and returns an Object pointer. 
With these tools, I can now parse class definitions and method definitions.
Up next, handling blocks, and probably some code reorganization. 
</p>
